# Gmail-UI-clone
This project is a meticulously crafted front-end clone of the classic Gmail user interface, developed solely using HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling. The primary objective was to replicate the visual layout, aesthetic, and user experience of Gmail's web application as closely as possible, demonstrating a strong understanding of fundamental web development principles.
